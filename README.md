# Projects for Differential and difference equations course at AGH UST

## First project
Solution of first order differential equation using following methods:
* Euler first order method
* Midpoint second order method
* Taylor series third order method
* Runge-Kutta fourth order method
with their comparison. Writtern in Python programming language with usage of JupyterNotebook.

## Second project
Solution to second order differential equation using finite difference method (FDM) of second order,
and its comparison with exact sollution.
Includes implementation of tridiagonal matrix algorithm (Thomas algorithm) for solving tridiagonal system of equations in linear time.

Technologies used:
* R language
* LaTeX
* Knitr for integration R into LaTeX
